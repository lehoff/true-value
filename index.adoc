== The true value of a goal in football

Fans of football often end up in heated debates about which player who scores
the most important goals.

In the brilliant book 
https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-numbers-game/chris-anderson/david-sally/9780241963623["The Numbers Game"] 
by Chris Anderson and David Sally there is a whole chapter dedicated to the 
marginal value of a goal: "They Should Have Bought Darren Bent". They look at how many 
extra points the first goal, second goal and so on provides. 
Turns out that Darren Bent was the most consistent point scorer over 
the two seasons - 2009/10 and 2010/11 - they analyse.
